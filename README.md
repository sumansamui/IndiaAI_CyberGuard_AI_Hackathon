## Problem Statement : Development of an NLP Model for Text Analytics and Classification

## Objective:
To develop an NLP model that categorizes complaint based on victim, type
of fraud and other relevant parameters used for text classification and
preparing the final model.

## This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for developing an NLP model (text classifier) that categorizes complaints based on victim, type of fraud, and other relevant parameters. 

## The code contains the following necessary steps:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and text cleaning to prepare data.
- **Model Development**: Selection of a suitable NLP model for text classification. The following models are explored: Naive Bayes, Random Forrest, XGBoost, SVM (RBF), SVM (polynomial), DistilBERT Model. 

- **Accuracy Measurement**: Evaluate the model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to run this project on your own machine?


Next, clone this project by opening a terminal and typing the following commands (do not type the first `$` signs on each line, they just indicate that these are terminal commands):

    $ git clone https://github.com/sumansamui/IndiaAI_CyberGuard_AI_Hackathon.git
    
    $ conda create --name <env_name> python==3.10

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run End_to_End_Full_pipeline_NLP.ipynb in Jupyter nootbook or VS Code
