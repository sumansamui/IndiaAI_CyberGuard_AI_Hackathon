# IndiaAI CyberGuard AI Hackathon

Problem Statement : Development of an NLP Model for Text Analytics and Classification

Objective:
o To develop an NLP model that categorizes complaint based on victim, type
of fraud and other relevant parameters used for text classification and
preparing the final model.

## This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for developing an NLP model (text classifier) that categorizes complaints based on victim, type of fraud, and other relevant parameters. 

## The code contains the following necessary steps:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and text cleaning to prepare data.
- **Model Development**: Selection of a suitable NLP model for text classification. The following models are explored: Naive Bayes, Random Forrest, XGBoost, SVM (RBF), SVM (polynomial), DistilBERT Model. 

- **Accuracy Measurement**: Evaluate the model based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
